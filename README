Ranvier bundle to have NPCs interactable via [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/)

You will need an account with api.ai and you will need to put your developer key in a file called `APIAIKEY` in the same
directory as this README file.

The behavior as-implemented is based off the agent provided in the `resources/` directory of this bundle (`agent.zip`.)
See the Dialogflow documentation on how to import an agent.
